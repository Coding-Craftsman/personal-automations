The documentation site is finally live(ish)!  I have spent a little bit of time actually trying to write the docs and make them somewhat presentable.  I still am unable to build/test the site locally because I am to lazy to install what I need on my desktop to actually run the jekyll tools, eventually I will either install them or get docker to work so I can use it :D.

The docs have a good start with the two main automations that I have built (Trello board and the base coffee spreadsheet stuff).
