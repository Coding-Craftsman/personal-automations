# Coffee Spreadsheet automation

This automation automatically adds values to the coffee tracking spreadsheet that I use to track the coffee I buy for work.  The spreadsheet is a simple Google sheet that has two worksheets in it.  The first sheet lists the amount I paid each month for coffee and the sums the total of what I have paid while the second sheet tracks who has paid and how much they have paid.  The spreadsheet totals up the amounts and compares the amount to show if people owe me again or not.

# Granting the automation account access to a sheet

You must first share the sheet with the account you created in the Google Cloud control panel

Click on the share button on the sheet and add the email address created in the control panel and make it an editor
